## Updating

2021/04

The related paper, "Voxel Structure-based Mesh Reconstruction from a 3D Point Cloud", is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia.

2020/11

Project name has been changed to Voxel structure-based mesh reconstruction.
For now, it is a pre-version which includes the inital mesh reconstruction without mesh optimization. When related papers are published, then the complete version will be released.

2020/07

The code of Parallel Structure, which is used to reconstruct mesh from 3D Point Cloud.

The project is build on VS2019.

There have some open support library should be included in the project:

OpenGL:freeglut

CGAL library

PCL library

The project has relationship with AIVS simplification. Therefore the project is called AIVS Remesh.
